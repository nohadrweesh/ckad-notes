- Multicontainer pods share smae lifecycycle (create & destroy together), share same network space (can refer to each other as localhost), smae volumes
- MultiContainer Patterns:
  - Sidecar (Log Agent) --> collects logs and sends to Log server
  - Adapter (Different Log formats) --> change logs formats to be unified
  - Amabassdor (Different DBs) --> so code will refer to it as DB and the ambassdor will procy request to DEV/Prod DB
