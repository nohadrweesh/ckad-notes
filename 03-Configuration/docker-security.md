- Containers isolated using namespaces
- By default docker runs proccess as root user
- This can be changed either by setting USER 1000 in docker file or at running the image docker run --user=1000 nginx
- root user in host is not root user in containers, docker implements this using capabilities
- docker run --cap-add MAC_ADMIN or docker run --cap-drop MAC_ADMIN
- To run with all capabilities docker run --priviliged
