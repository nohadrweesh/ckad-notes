- Heapster(Deprecated) VS metric server
- metric server is In-Mem monitoring solution --> so metrics are not stored on the disk so you can't see historical performance data
- cAdvisor on nodes that collects pod data
- Enable metrics-server then you can use `k top node` and `k top pod` to view node and pod data for cpu and mem
